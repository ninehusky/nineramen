Tests I've performed in Postman but should implement again sometime soon:

- GET /users/ correctly sends list of users
- GET /users/:id correctly gives user

- POST /users/ with empty body correctly sends 422 response
  - POST /users/ with missing password sends 422
  - POST /users/ with missing username sends 422
  - POST /users/ with short/long/invalid username sends 422
  - POST /users/ with short password sends 422
- POST /users/ with name that's already taken throws 422
- POST /users/ with invalid changes throws 400 error
- POST /users/ with correct username/password successfully creates user

- PATCH /users/ (i.e., no ID) gives 405
- PATCH /users/:id with empty body gives 400
- PATCH /users/:id with invalid ID gives 400
- PATCH /users/:id with ID that doesn't exist gives 404
- PATCH /users/:id with invalid properties gives 400
- PATCH /users/:id with invalid values gives 422
- PATCH /users/:id with valid properties succesfuly changes user

- DELETE /user/ (i.e., no ID) gives 405
- DELETE /user/:id with invalid ID gives 400
- DELETE /users/:id with ID that doesn't exist gives 404
- DELETE users/:id with valid ID succesfully deletes user
