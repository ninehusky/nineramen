                To put it shortly, <strong>no. </strong>
                I've been working with JavaScript for about a year, and this is my first project that involves any sort of
                user data protection. I've done my best with what I know to secure your passwords, but I would heavily advise against
                using a username/password combination with my website that you use for other websites as well.
              </p>
            </div>
            In other words, I try my hardest to protect the username/password pairs, but I don't think I know quite enough for you
            to put the same faith in me that you put into your banks and Facebook accounts.
