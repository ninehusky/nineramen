An exploration into the field of linguistics cleverly disguised as a JS project.

More seriously, nineramen is a project designed to elevate the emojipasta experience.

## What is an emojipasta?

An emojipasta is an evolution of the copypasta, which according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copypasta), is "a block of text which is copied and pasted across the internet by individuals through online forums." Generally speaking, across the board copypastas are made to ridicule/satirize the sometimes excessive and ridiculous people that one can find on the internet. This can be seen in the infamous "Navy Seal" copypasta, which is a "lengthy ... aggressive attack paragraph ... written in the voice of the stereotypical 'tough guy'".

To further highlight the ridiculousness of those who are being mocked with a copypasta, some have taken to including egregious amounts of emojis. Here is a copypasta (courtesy of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emojipasta/comments/hvbndl/harvard/)) presumably making fun of parents who overly embellish their children's accomplishments:

> Today 📅 my 12 😣🕛 year 📅 old 👴 son 👦 and I 👥 walked 🚶 into harvard 👩‍🎓 to sign 🚧 him 👴 up ☝ for college 🚌📚. The dean rudly asked ❓ what a 12 😣🕛 year 🗓 old 👴 was doing signing 🖊 up ⬆ for such a prestigious 🎖🏆 institute like 👍 harvard 👩‍🎓. My son 🙎‍♂️ took 👫 of to reveal 💡 his 🤦 Rick 👨🏻‍🔬 and Morty 😡😵 shirt 👕 and proclaimed "Well 🖕🖕🏻🖕🏿 you 👆 see 👁 sir 🤔 I 👁 watch 👁 Rick 🥒 and Morty 😡😵". A look 👀 of confusion ❓🤔 came 💦 over 😳🙊💦 the deans face 😀 and I 👁 have never 🚫 been so proud 😤. The dean quickly ⚡ made 👉 sure 💯 to appologize to my son 👦 but 👆🍑👀 it was too late 💤, the police 👮‍♂️ rushed 🏃‍♂️ in and dragged him 👨🏾 out. My son 👦 passed 📆 all 🙌 his 🤦 classes 📒 with 4.0s and graduated 🔝 top 🔝 of his 🤦 class 📒 in the first 🥇 day 📅 of college 🏘👱📚.

## How do you automate the process of converting a copypasta (or other plaintext) into emojipasta?

If you look at the emojipasta in the section above, you'll find that words of interest map to certain emojis. These word-emoji connections can be quite literal ("walked" maps to 🚶), but they can also be relatively "abstract" as well (i.e., the 'average' person wouldn't be able to understand the connection).
